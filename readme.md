## Firmware / Code

The ESP32 firmware lives in the [`Code`](https://github.com/elcrni/Speed-Respooler-V2/tree/main/Code) folder.

You can use the project in two ways:

- **ESPHome (YAML)** — for users who want easy setup, OTA updates, and Home Assistant integration.
- **Arduino sketch (`.ino`)** — a standalone firmware option if you prefer the classic Arduino workflow (flash via Arduino IDE / PlatformIO).

Pick the version that matches your setup and workflow.
