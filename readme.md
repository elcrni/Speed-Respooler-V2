## Firmware

The ESP32 code is in the [`code/`](./code) folder.

This repository includes two firmware options for **[PROJECT / DEVICE NAME HERE]**:
- **ESPHome (YAML)** — for Home Assistant / ESPHome users who want simple configuration and OTA updates.
- **Arduino (`.ino`)** — for users who prefer a classic Arduino workflow or want to modify the firmware directly.

Both versions target the same hardware and features — pick whichever fits your setup.
